            Hello! I am Trevor Bolles I am a current student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying to become a software engineer. 
            I have spent most of my time working on backend development as well as learning general programming principles. I am very

            When I am not coding I like to do a lot of different things from watching shows with friends to going on backpacking trips with
            my family. I am also a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and have been my entire life.
            over the course of my studies a quote that I really love comes from Joseph Smith when talkinga about receiving revelation
            or answers to our prayers. He Says â€œA person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation;
